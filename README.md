# Laravel API starter

## Idea behind Laravel API starter

Even though Laravel provides quick and easy way to develop API backends, it still takes some time to write 
authentication, which is usually same for most of the projects. To tackle this problem, this started was created, keeping it
as minimal as possible.

This starter has only register/login api routes and absolutely nothing else.
